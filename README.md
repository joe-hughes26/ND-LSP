## N Dimensional Lomb Scargle Periodogram

## Description
The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) is a very useful numerical tool for spectral analysis. However, it is only supported in one dimension in scipy at the time of this writing. This code provides a multivariate extension to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in python. This code accompanies a journal manuscript currently under review. I will return here once published and add a link to the paper

## Usage
The single file on this github page contains the ND LSP function and a quick demonstration and visualization for one and two-dimensional datasets.
